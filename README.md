# Exploring Python's `map()` Function with Lambda Expressions

**Author:** shokomori  
**Title:** Exploring Python's map() Function with Lambda Expressions  

## Description

This script demonstrates how to use Python's built-in `map()` function in combination with `lambda` expressions to perform various element-wise operations on lists. The examples cover:

- Adding elements from two or more lists
- Subtracting elements between lists
- Squaring each number in a list
- Handling empty lists gracefully

Each operation showcases how powerful and concise functional programming can be in Python.

## Examples Included

1. **Addition** of two lists: `[1, 2, 3] + [6, 7, 8] â†’ [7, 9, 11]`
2. **Handling an empty list** with `map()`
3. **Squaring** elements in a list
4. **Subtraction** between two lists
5. **Addition** using **three** lists simultaneously

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, simply run:

```bash
python filename.py
